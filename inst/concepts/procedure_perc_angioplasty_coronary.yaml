name: Percutaneous coronary intervention
definition: |
    Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is defined as the placement of an angioplasty guidewire, balloon, or other device (e.g. stent, atherectomy, brachytherapy, or thrombectomy catheter) into a native coronary artery or a graft for the purpose of mechanical coronary revascularisation. The assessment of coronary lesion severity by fluoroscopy, intracoronary imaging (e.g. intravascular ultrasonography) or physiology (e.g. fractional flow reserve) is not considered a PCI procedure.
