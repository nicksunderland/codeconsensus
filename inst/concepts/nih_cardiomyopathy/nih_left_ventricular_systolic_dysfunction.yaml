name: Left ventricular systolic dysfunction
definition: |
  Left ventricular systolic dysfunction is defined here as any code
  indicating impaired LV ejection fraction, or heart failure with reduced
  or mid-range ejection fraction. HF reduced ejection fraction is defined as HF with
  LVEF<40% and HF mid-range ejection fraction with LVEF 40-49%.
