name: Non-ischaemic cardiomyopathy
definition: |
  We defined nonischemic cardiomyopathy (NICM) on the basis of left ventricular
  dysfunction and absence of coronary artery disease (CAD). A priori,
  individuals were considered to have left ventricular dysfunction if they
  carried ICD-10 diagnoses of dilated cardiomyopathy or left ventricular failure,
  or an ICD-9 diagnosis of left heart failure. Indicators for CAD included
  myocardial infarction or coronary revascularization, as described previously.
  Myocardial infarction was defined as a self-report of heart attack or an
  ICD-10 code of acute myocardial infarction. Coronary revascularization
  was defined as the presence of an operative or procedure code for
  coronary artery bypass surgery or coronary angioplasty
