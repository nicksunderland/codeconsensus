name: Heart Failure (HFrEF or HFmrEF)
definition: |
  Heart failure (HF) is not a single pathological diagnosis, but a clinical syndrome consisting of
  cardinal symptoms (e.g. breathlessness, ankle . swelling, and fatigue) that may be accompanied
  by signs (e.g. elevated . jugular venous pressure, pulmonary crackles, and peripheral oedema).
  It is due to a structural and/or functional abnormality of the heart that results in elevated
  intracardiac pressures and/or inadequate cardiac output at rest and/or during exercise. HF reduced
  ejection fraction is defined as HF with LVEF<40% and HF mid-range ejection fraction with LVEF 40-49%.
