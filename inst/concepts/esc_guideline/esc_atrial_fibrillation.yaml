name: Atrial fibrillation
definition: |
  Symptomatic or asymptomatic AF that is clearly documented by an ECG (12-lead ECG or other ECG devices). The minimum duration to establish the diagnosis of clinical AF for ambulatory ECG is not clear and depends on the clinical context. Periods of 30 seconds or more may indicate clinical concern, and trigger further monitoring or risk stratification for thromboembolism.
