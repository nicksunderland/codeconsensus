name: Atrial flutter
definition: |
  Atrial flutter describes a group of macro-re-entrant atrial tachycardias . Typical AFL is caused by a right atrial re-entrant circuit involving the cavotricuspid isthmus (CTI-dependent) and is associated with a regular saw-tooth pattern of atrial activity with rates of 240-300 bpm. Atypical AFL comprises a heterogeneous group of right and left MRATs not involving the cavotricuspid isthmus (CTI-independent).
