name: Percutaneous coronary intervention
definition: |
  Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is defined as the placement of an
  angioplasty guidewire, balloon, or other device (e.g. stent, atherectomy,
  brachytherapy, or thrombectomy catheter) into a native coronary artery or a graft
  for the purpose of mechanical coronary revascularisation. The assessment of
  coronary lesion severity by fluoroscopy, intracoronary imaging (e.g. intravascular
  ultrasonography) or physiology (e.g. fractional flow reserve) is not considered
  a PCI procedure.
