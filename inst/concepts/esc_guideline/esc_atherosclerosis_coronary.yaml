name: Atherosclerosis (coronary)
definition: |
  A disease in which there is a narrowing or blockage of the coronary arteries due to atherosclerosis (a buildup
  of fatty material and plaque inside the coronary arteries). This definition includes the concept of ischaemic
  heart disease or myocardial ischaemia but is not intended to include other proxies for the presence of coronary
  atherosclerosis, for example codes for definite myocardial infarction (without mention of coronary atheroma)
  or procedure codes for coronary intervention, which are defined in separate concepts.
