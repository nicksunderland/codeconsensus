notes: |-
  Include codes and text descriptions that represent sudden death presumed to be
  of cardiac origin. Exclude clearly non-cardiac causes such as trauma, overdose,
  or terminal illness. Where available, consider additional temporal qualifiers
  (e.g., death within 1 hour of symptom onset). Use in conjunction with cause-of-death data if present.
